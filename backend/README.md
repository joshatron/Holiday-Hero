Holiday Hero Backend
====================

The goal for this application is to store present receiving and giving data.

A user should have one or more wish lists, which they can make visible to everyone, friends, or selected.
Other users can check off items they get the user, or manually enter the item.
Everyone but the user will be able to see what the user got besides the user.
The user will select specific days for the list to reset, ex: birthday, christmas, etc.

The app can also keep track of what you are getting people.
This will be nicely integrated for other users, but can also be done for people not using the app.
For each present, the user can keep track of the status of the present: chosen, ordered, received, wrapped.
